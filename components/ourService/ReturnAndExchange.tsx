      <p>
        <strong>SHEIN STYLE STORE</strong> 7-day Exchange policy gives you the
        option to exchange items purchased from the{" "}
        <strong>SHEIN STYLE STORE</strong> website/m- site/Application for any
        reason within 7 days of receipt of the item. We only ask that you don't
        use the product and preserve its original condition, tags and packaging.
        You are welcome to try on a product but please take adequate measures to
        preserve its condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Exchange Fee:</strong> For all exchanges, a nominal exchange fee
        of Rs. 99 will be charged, which will be included in the replacement
        order invoice. This fee helps cover the cost of processing and handling
        the exchange.

        Kindly note, all exchanges are subject to stock availability. Please
        also note that we only offer size exchanges. If you wish to exchange
        your item for an alternate product, we suggest that you return it to
        obtain store credit and purchase the new item separately.
